## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm, trustworthy blue (#4A8FE7) reminiscent of financial stability and reliability. The hue is associated with competence and professionalism, avoiding the clich√© of green for a financial app.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E8F0FE) creating a clean, uncluttered backdrop that helps ensure legibility of the primary content. Its low saturation means it will not compete with the primary or accent color.
- Accent color: A contrasting vibrant purple (#9050E3), drawing the eye to key interactive elements without overwhelming the interface.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif), delivering a geometric, contemporary, precise and fashionable style, suiting headings perfectly. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), ensures a neutral, readable style suitable for longer text.
- Responsive SaaS layout with a dedicated sidebar for main navigation and a primary content area for delegation tasks.
- Crisp, modern icons representing each delegation category for intuitive navigation and quick identification.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide user feedback, creating a smooth and engaging experience during navigation and form interactions.
